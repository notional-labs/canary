  "description": "\n\nOne of the major reasons that the Gravity Bridge is not being released onto the hub is because it needs to be tested first.\n\nWe propose to create a new chain, with the tokens airdropped 100% to ATOM holders. \n\n By creating this chain, features can be tested that might be harmful to the hub, while retaining sovereignty for ATOM holders. \n\n The token shall be called 'photons' because the development will travel at the speed of light.  \n\n This chain will be a place where new features can be tested before transitioning to the hub. More dangerous plays can be made in WarpZone, and it should be considered to have a warning label like a pack of cigarettes. \n\n The first feature being, the Gravity Bridgeâ„¢ \n\n The snapshot for the token allocation will be at the end of this proposal period, and will exclude exchange validators/delegators as they are detrimental for fast moving governance. \n\n Once the bridge is deemed production ready it can be transitioned to the hub by another governance proposal.",
